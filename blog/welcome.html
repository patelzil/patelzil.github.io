        <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio is my evidence locker. As I transition from backend
          software engineering to AI engineering, I need a place to document
          what I'm building and learning. Not a resume, not a marketing site,
          just a simple, honest record of my work.
        </p>
        <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I'm inspired by
          <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison's</a> minimalist
          approach to personal websites and HTML tools. Their sites are fast,
          simple, and focused on content. No frameworks, no build steps (unless
          you want them), no maintenance burden.
        </p>
        <p>This site is built with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pure HTML and CSS (no React, no Vue, no frameworks)</li>
          <li>Vanilla JavaScript for any interactive tools</li>
          <li>
            HTML for blog posts (optional Python script to convert Markdown to HTML)
          </li>
          <li>Zero dependencies to maintain or update</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What I'm Building</h2>
        <p>
          I'm focusing on practical AI engineering - RAG systems, LLM
          applications, voice agents, and the infrastructure that makes them
          work in production. I bring years of backend experience and I'm
          applying that foundation to AI/ML systems.
        </p>
        <h2>Build in Public</h2>
        <p>
          Adding new content to this site is as simple as creating a markdown
          file and running the build script to convert to HTML (or write HTML
          directly). No complex deployment pipelines, no framework updates, no
          breaking changes. Just create a file and push to GitHub. That's it.
        </p>
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
          I'll be documenting projects as I build them, writing about what I
          learn, and creating small HTML tools for specific problems. The goal
          is to maximize time spent building and learning, not maintaining a
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in AI engineering, backend systems, or building
          in public, follow along. I'll be updating this site regularly as I
          ship new work.
